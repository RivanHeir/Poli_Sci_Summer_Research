# Poli_Sci_Summer_Research

This project is the output of the research I completed for Dr. Chris Chapp in the summer of 2023. Dr. Chapp had a manuscript which would become his book _Moral Issues
How Public Opinion on Abortion and Gay Rights Affects American Religion and Politics_ (cowritten with Paul Goren), but his election data extended only to the 2018 midterm elections. My task was to replicate these tables, with data updated from the 2020 and 2022 elections. 

The first task I had was to analyze news article, categorized by keywords into one of three categories: Taxes, Health, and Moral (Abortion and LGBT). To do this, I scraped data from online archives of the New York Times, Washington Post, and Associated Press. I combined this with similar data from Colin Harris, and successfully provided updated counts to Dr. Chapp. 

Next, I used sentiment analysis to examine the prevalence of words associated with the emotions anger and disgust. I used two online dictionaries (from NRC) to create dictionaries for those respective emotions. Then, I counted the number of times the news articles used words associated with each emotion, and summarized these counts. 

## Deliverables

I created four CSVs (one for each RMD) with the desired data: article counts over time from AP, NYT, and Washington Post, for each category; and summaries of the proportions of "anger" and "disgust"-coded words in articles in the Moral, Health, and Tax categories. I am waiting for permission from Dr. Chapp to include the data, results CSVs, and images. 

## Documents and CSVs Summary

For this project, I created four RMD files: _AP-Poli_Sci_Project.Rmd_, _NYTimes-Poli_Sci-Project.Rmd_, _WaPo-Poli_Sci_Project.Rmd_, and _Sentiment Analysis.Rmd_. 

Additionally, the NRC dictionaries _anger-NRC-Emotion-Lexicon.txt_ and _disgust-NRC-Emotion-Lexicon.txt_ were used for the sentiment analysis. 

## Packages

This research was performed in the ROAR server, on RStudio. We used the packages _rmarkdown_, _knitr_, _readtext_, _tidyverse_, _lubridate_, _data.table_, _rvest_, _tidytext_, _tm_, and _pdftools_.
